# rtapp

TO SETUP:

1. open the app in xcode
2. open 'for git' folder, and drag the two image files to the 'supporting files' folder in the project

(this may or may not be necessary)
3. look at the screenshot 'other libraries to link.' it should be clear how to get to that screen (follow the highlights)
4. link the necessary libraries



ALSOOOOOOOO I made it for the 5s, so it still works in other sizes but the layout will be off.
